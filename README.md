<h1 align="center">Fake Image Server</h1>

It's hard to choose suitable image placeholders when you are working on a front-end project. **Fake Image Server** aims to reduce your work by generating clean images with an URL.

## How to use
Use the `src` attribute to load fake svg images.
```
<img src="https://holder.moyu.io/300">
<img src="https://holder.moyu.io/300/200">
<img src="https://holder.moyu.io/300/200?bg=000&color=fff">
<img src="https://holder.moyu.io/300?text=Hello&size=40">
```
